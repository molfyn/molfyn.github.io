<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s taken nine years to get that much money&hellip;it is essential that you think &ldquo;long tail&rdquo; about your games.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This 2016 GDC talk is from an indie developer who largely made match-three games. It&rsquo;s mostly a narrative lifestory style.</p>

<h1 id="the-key-takes">The Key Takes:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sell your game on many stores, even small ones.</li>
<li>Spend money on art and music. $2000 is a good amount for a game that nets $90,000.</li>
<li>Even a match-three game takes months! 500 hours = 12.5 weeks, or just over three months full-time.</li>
<li>Even though your games can make money, remember you have living expenses (wife and kids = indie hard mode)</li>
<li>Focus on making one type of game and iterate.</li>
<li>Dividends pay over a long period of time.</li>
<li>You can polish and republish old properties.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-story">The Story:</h1>

<ul>
<li>First game was a fail, too ambitious</li>
<li>Second game, match-three, sold 1600 over ten years</li>
<li>Third made 2000: improved art and assets</li>
<li>next two, no sales</li>
<li>Then when the Wizard of Oz IP expired he did an Oz themed game, made 90k. First year only 20k.</li>
<li>Made another, renewed christmas themed game. This one he &ldquo;kept alive&rdquo;:

<ul>
<li>Re-promote every year (he emailed casual portals and asked them to promote it)</li>
<li>Localization</li>
<li>New portals (they dropped their standards?)</li>
<li>A few years later did a GOLD version, just adding more levels</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you look at it hourly, the games made progressively more per hour, up to about 200/hr in the new revamped christmas theme game.</li>
<li>This biggest hit game, only sold 1000 units in the first year (only 6 percent of the total!)</li>
<li>Because of this long tail phenomenon, it is recommended not to heavily discount or bundle in the first year&hellip; or maybe ever?</li>
<li>Then he did contract work (two games, for a year or two), then moved to vancouver for a fulltime position. This &ldquo;paid off his debts&rdquo;.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://molfyn.github.io/images/workhours-springbonus.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Later, he quit and worked on the game Spring Bonus, where he was able to leverage techniques he learned from his fulltime work such as:

<ul>
<li>testing metrics (for balance)</li>
<li>crowdsourced localization (don&rsquo;t do this)</li>
<li>recruited artists through social media &ldquo;made a big list of them, tested them, went through and picked the ones I needed&rdquo;</li>
<li>Paid artists some upfront plus a revshare</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In this product, he made about 130 an hour (down from 200), would have made &ldquo;much more&rdquo; if he hadn&rsquo;t spent, &ldquo;hours and hours on stupid mobile ports because: [cut to slide] mobile is shit&rdquo;</li>
<li>He has some slides about his revenue</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is really important to remember that every game project will take longer than you think it will take. A game project is never quick.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Then made a card game, english culture-themed game. Applied for a grant with it.

<ul>
<li>Many awards</li>
<li>Only got press once it came out on steam, even though steam was only 14 percent of revenue.</li>
<li>This game he made with his wife and he discusses the difficulties of that.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>According to him, the best recommendation is to get a cat, the stroking of which helps with stress and idea generation.</p></li>

<li><p>Recommended watching: &ldquo;Funding Case Studies&rdquo; by Jason Della Rocca.</p></li>
</ul>
